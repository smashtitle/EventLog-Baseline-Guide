"Remote Access Tool - Action1 Arbitrary Code Execution and Remote Sessions","medium","","process_creation","Detects the execution of Action1 in order to execute arbitrary code or establish a remote session.

Action1 is a powerful Remote Monitoring and Management tool that enables users to execute commands, scripts, and binaries.
Through the web interface of action1, the administrator must create a new policy or an app to establish remote execution and then points that the agent is installed.

Hunting Opportunity 1- Weed Out The Noise

When threat actors execute a script, a command, or a binary through these new policies and apps, the names of these become visible in the command line during the execution process. Below is an example of the command line that contains the deployment of a binary through  a policy with name ""test_app_1"":

ParentCommandLine: ""C:\WINDOWS\Action1\action1_agent.exe schedule:Deploy_App__test_app_1_1681327673425 runaction:0""

After establishing a baseline, we can split the command to extract the policy name and group all the policy names and inspect the results with a list of frequency occurrences.

Hunting Opportunity 2 - Remote Sessions On Out Of Office Hours

If you have admins within your environment using remote sessions to administer endpoints, you can create a threat-hunting query and modify the time of the initiated sessions looking for abnormal activity.

This log is generated when
1. A user connects to a server or runs a program locally using alternate credentials.
   For instance a user maps a drive to a server but specifies a different user's credentials or opens a shortcut under RunAs by shift-control-right-clicking on the shortcut,
   selecting Run as..., and then filling in a different user's credentials in the dialog box that appears.  Or a user logs on to a web site using new specific credentials.
2. When a process logs on as a different account such as when the Scheduled Tasks service starts a task as the specified user.
3. With User Account Control enabled, an end user runs a program requiring admin authority.  You will get this event where the process information is consent.exe.
   Unfortunately the Subject does not identify the end user.
4. Logging on interactively to a server with a domain account. (Two 4624 events will also be generated.)
This logon event is unique in that it is logged on the source computer and not the target computer like most other logon events.
Also, it will be logged regardless of the logon being successful or not so consider it an attempt and not necessarily an actual successful logon.

Also, it is recommended to turn off ""Local Group Policy Object Processing"" via GPO, which will make sure that Active Directory GPOs take precedence over local/edited computer policies via something such as ""gpedit.msc"".
Please note, that disabling ""Local Group Policy Object Processing"" may cause an issue in scenarios of one off specific GPO modifications - however, it is recommended to perform these modifications in Active Directory anyways.
